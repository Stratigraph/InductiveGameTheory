This repository contains the code and data needed to replicate the paper's results, organized as follows:

**fast_calc/**: Cython code to accelerate the conditional probability calculation

**src/**: Main code and analyses

*Main tools*

**Eventseries.py**: Main class to handle the event series and calculations on it, particularly finding the correlation network.

**GenerativeModel.py**: Code for the generative model, including the null model and several goodness-of-fit tests.

*Analyses and results* 


**SIPRI Analysis Europe.ipynb**: The initial pass on the analysis; generates the initial correlation network **probs_n_100.pickle** and some first pass goodness-of-fit measures that are not used in the final paper.

**SIPRI Analysis Europe - v2.ipynb**: Main analysis for the in-sample prediction test (4.1 Analysis I).

**SIPRI Analysis Europe 90s.ipynb**: Out of sample prediction, using **probs-91_n_100.pickle** correlation network data (4.2 Analysis II).

**Correlation network drawing.ipynb**: Drawing the correlation network (paper Fig. 1).
